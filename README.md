# Python Web Scraping Scripts

In this script I will be experimenting with the Python programming languages and its abilities to scrape data from websites. My goal is to end up with a program with a command line interface that will display news items, filtered with keywords that are passed in as command line arguments. The sites it uses as sources will be defined in the source code of the program.
